          <p className="text-2xl text-gray-800 pt-1">
          The ASCI community thrives on a strong collaboration with the Computer Science (CS) 
          department, which serves as a pivotal force in shaping the community's identity and 
          purpose. This collaboration is grounded in a shared vision to elevate the department 
          to global stature in the realms of computer science education, research, and development.
          </p>
          <p className="text-2xl text-gray-800 pt-5">
          At the heart of this collaboration lies a collective commitment to equipping graduates 
          in the field of computer science with not only competent technical and analytical skills 
          but also fostering innovative research capabilities and nurturing leadership potential. 
          The ASCI community and the CS department work hand in hand to create an educational 
          environment that goes beyond the traditional boundaries, aiming to produce graduates 
          who are not just proficient in their technical skills but are also well-versed in 
          pushing the boundaries of knowledge through cutting-edge research.
          </p>
          <p className="text-2xl text-gray-800 pt-5">
          In pursuit of this vision, the ASCI community emphasizes the cultivation of integrity, 
          discipline, and ethical values among its members. The goal is to instill in graduates 
          a strong sense of responsibility and commitment to societal progress. This collaborative 
          effort between the ASCI community and the CS department is dedicated to creating a 
          dynamic and inclusive learning space where students are not only prepared for the 
          challenges of the rapidly evolving field of computer science but are also instilled with 
          a sense of purpose to contribute meaningfully to society.
